This is a custom website built with Express that queries the [MH Wilds Public API](https://docs.wilds.mhdb.io) to display information about the Large Monsters and Locations. Monsters can be filtered by Location and Species, and Locations can be filtered by Name and Camp Danger Level, as well as random filters for both.
